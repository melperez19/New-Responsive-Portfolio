                <p>Hi There! Thanks for stopping by my page :). My name is Melissa Perez and I'm 31 years old,
                    born of hispanic descent and raised in
                    Perth Amboy, New Jersey. I gradudated college in
                    2009 with a BA in Art and Art History and have dabbled in different job titles
                    since then (ex. Cartooning Instructor for kids at the local art gallery,
                    portrait photographer, and archive generalist/ Photoshop editor for an online art and framing
                    company). I've been working in digital printing for a little
                    over 3 years now on the production end creating banners and other
                    promotional products. I love working with computers, files, and layouts and I'm now at the point
                    where I want to move from the production side of helping businesses and focus on building
                    their online presence. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive web development course in hopes
                    of achieving this new professional goal. </p>
                <p>Some random facts about me : I'm shy, but friendly and quite hilarious once I come out of my shell.
                    Anyone who knows me knows that I love hats and music. I learned how to play guitar and have
                    explored my inner coolness with DJing. I have a beautiful soon to be 6yr old daughter and an
                    amazing partner who inspires me every day. I'm the youngest of 3 siblings and family is everything.</p>
                <p> Please feel free to explore my website and contact me for more information on credentials and
                    possible projects! Thanks :)</p>
